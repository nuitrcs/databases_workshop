So they'll require some thought and possibly a little more research/reading.  Try them with a partner or group."

    "One thing that isn't easy to do with SQL is selecting random rows.  There are functions to generate random values, but generating a new random column on a large table, and then sorting by that column (or computing the max value and then selecting an observation) is costly.  This is one scenario when working with a database from Python is useful.\n",

Do this without reading the entire table into Python.  Hint: you'll probably want to use some combination of sorting the table, limiting the number of rows you retrieve, and offsetting results (which we probably didn't cover: learn more [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-limit/) or [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_limit_clause.htm))."
